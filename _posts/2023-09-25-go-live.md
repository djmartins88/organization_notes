The application is now live and available for installation using the [Zendesk Marketplace](https://www.zendesk.com/marketplace/apps/support/923793/organization-notes/)! This is version, 1.0, allows Zendesk Agents to write notes about a specific Organization within your Zendesk account, that will then be available to all the other Agents working on tickets for that specific Organization.

On the upcoming releases I'm planning to add a ways to allow your team to identify that customer's specific traits, in a feature we'll call "tags".

I'd love to read your feedback about the app, so please don't hesitate to write an e-mail with feedback, or if you run into any issues, please let me know by tracking them on the project's [Github issues page](https://github.com/djmartins88/organization_notes/issues).
